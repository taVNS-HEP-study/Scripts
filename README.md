# taVNS-EEG-study
EEGLAB and MATLAB-based pre-processing and analysis scripts associated with doi: 10.1016/j.brs.2021.12.004. 
Most of the preprocessing was done in MATLAB & EEGLAB. Subsequent analysis stages were done using the Brainstorm GUI interface, a visual tutorial with screenshots is forthcoming... 
The documentation & files uploaded here is currently a work in progress to make it easier for others to do similar types of studies. If you want to use any of these scripts and have questions, feel free to contact me at tasha.poppa at gmail.com
