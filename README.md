EEGLAB and MATLAB-based pre-processing and analysis scripts associated with doi: 10.1016/j.brs.2021.12.004. 
Nearly all the preprocessing was done in MATLAB & EEGLAB. Subsequent analysis stages were done using the Brainstorm GUI. If you want to use any of these scripts and have questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me at tasha.poppa at gmail.com
