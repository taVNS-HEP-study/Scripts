EEGLAB and MATLAB-based pre-processing and analysis scripts associated with doi: 10.1016/j.brs.2021.12.004. 
Nearly all the preprocessing was done in MATLAB & EEGLAB. Subsequent analysis stages were done using the Brainstorm GUI. A visual tutorial for performing current source analyses using wMNE and BEM will be forthcoming... 
The goal is to make it easier for others to do HEP and/or EEG source analyses. If you want to use any of these scripts and have questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me at tasha.poppa at gmail.com
